# This is not Kubernetes the hardway

These are some notes on executing kubernetes the hardway, for personal use.
Please, refer to [Kubernetes the hardway](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) if you are trying to create a kubernetes cluster from scratch.

If you are not, [Stackpoint](stackpoint.io) is a nice place to try it (and also where I work  :smile:)
